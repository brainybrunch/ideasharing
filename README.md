Let's practice using Git and GitHub!

#### What's the difference between Git and GitHub?

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that allows you to easily keep track of file changes. It is basically a command-line **language** to manage your file versions.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an online **server** where you can host your projects (in folders called *repositories* or *repos*). You use Git to interact with GitHub, i.e. Git is the bridge between the files you have on your PC and the files that are on GitHub. It also has many tools that allow you to collaborate with others on the project.

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a language that allows you to make pretty posts like this one (click on `README.md > Raw` to see what it looks like in Markdown!). It's essentially a human-friendly way to write HTML code, and it powers a lot of the posts you can make on GitHub. The cheatsheet shows you the most important elements to get you started.
